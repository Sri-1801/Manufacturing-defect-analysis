# Manufacturing Defect Analysis Using Python

This project analyzes defect records from a simulated manufacturing plant to uncover key trends and provide actionable insights. It showcases how Python can be used to support quality control and safety improvements in engineering environments.

## 📊 Project Objective

To identify:
- Most common defect types
- Machines and shifts with the highest defect occurrences
- Monthly trends in defect reports
- High severity issues for safety analysis

## 🗂️ Dataset

Simulated dataset containing 500 records with the following columns:
- `Date`: Date of defect
- `Machine_ID`: Machine involved
- `Product_Line`: Type of product (Engine, Chassis, etc.)
- `Defect_Type`: Type of defect (Crack, Leak, etc.)
- `Shift`: Morning, Evening, or Night
- `Operator_ID`: Operator on duty
- `Defect_Severity`: Severity level (Low, Medium, High)

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Top 5 most frequent defect types identified
- Machine-wise defect breakdown to detect faulty machinery
- High severity issues mostly during night shifts
- Monthly defect trend visualized to detect peaks and drops

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## 📂 Files Included

- `Manufacturing_Defect_Analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with full code and analysis
- `Manufacturing_Defect_Data.csv` - Dataset used for analysis
